To install all libraries that were used run the following (please note that I used Python 3):

pip3 install -r requirements.txt


The analysis was conducted in the following jupyter notebooks:

bank-marketing-notebook.ipynb
telco-notebook.ipynb


In order to view the jupyter notebooks, please use the following command while you're in this folder and select the files above once the jupyter page opens up on your browser:

jupyter notebook


I believe the rest should be self-explanatory.
